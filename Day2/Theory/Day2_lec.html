    <h2>Introduction to Algebra</h2>
    <p>Mathematics is a vast field. It is impossible for one person to know everything there is to know in mathematics, even after a lifetime of study. And while it can be cumbersome, mathematics is also one of the most important fields of study. Right from how much to tip the waiter to when the universe began, all answers can be found due to the application of maths.<br><br>
    As we approach the higher classes, we see our introduction to algebra. In algebra, we substitute numbers with letters or alphabets to arrive at a solution. We use these letters like (x, a, b etc.) to represent unknown quantities in an equation. Then we solve the equation or algebra formula to arrive at a definite answer.<br><br> Algebra itself is divided into two major fields. The more basic functions that we learn in school are known as elementary algebra. Then the more advanced algebra formula, which is more abstract in nature fall under modern algebra, sometimes even known as abstract algebra.<br><br></p>

    <h2>Algebra Formula</h2>
    <p>Algebra includes both numbers and letters. Numbers are fixed, i.e. their value is known. Letters or alphabets are used to represent the unknown quantities in the algebra formula. Now, a combination of numbers, letters, factorials, matrices etc. is used to form an equation or formula. This is essentially the methodology for algebra.<br><br>Here, we will provide a list of all the important algebra formulas. The comprehensive list will allow the students to have a quick look before exams or refer to whenever they wish. Remember, only rote learning is not enough. You must also know how to effectively apply these formulas to a problem.</p>

    <ul>
        <li>a<sup>2</sup>-b<sup>2</sup>= (a-b)(a+b)</li>
        <li>(a+b)<sup>2</sup>+2ab+b<sup>2</sup></li>
        <li>(a-b)<sup>2</sup>-2ab+b<sup>2</sup></li>
        <li>(a+b+c)<sup>2</sup> =a<sup>2</sup>+b<sup>2</sup>+c<sup>2</sup>+2ab+2ac+2bc</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Chemical Formula</h2>
    <p>A chemical formula is a way of presenting information about the chemical proportions of atoms that constitute a particular chemical compound or molecule, using chemical element symbols, numbers, and sometimes also other symbols, such as parentheses, dashes, brackets, commas and plus (+) and minus (âˆ’) signs. These are limited to a single typographic line of symbols, which may include subscripts and superscripts. <br><br>A chemical formula is not a chemical name since it does not contain any words. Although a chemical formula may imply certain simple chemical structures, it is not the same as a full chemical structural formula. Chemical formulae can fully specify the structure of only the simplest of molecules and chemical substances, and are generally more limited in power than chemical names and structural formulae. <br><br>There are several chemical formulae, however, here is a list of most important Chemical Formulas in chemistry.</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Carbon monoxide formula:  CO</li>
        <li>Carbonic acid formula:  H<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub></li>
        <li>Potassium carbonate formula: K<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub></li>
        <li>Glycerol formula:  C<sub>3</sub>H<sub>8</sub>O<sub>3</sub></li>
    </ul>
