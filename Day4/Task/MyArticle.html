    <p><big><strong> The Shih Tzu </strong></big> is a small companion breed from Tibet believed to have been bred from the Pekingese and Lhasa Apso thousands of years ago. While their name means <i>"little lion"</i>, there’s nothing fierce about this dog. Friendly and affectionate, they’ve made themselves comfortable on the laps of people from all walks of life since ancient times. Today, these little dogs have found their way into homes as family companions, cherished for their small size, devoted temperament, silky and low-shedding coat, and adaptability to different living environments, including apartments.</p>
